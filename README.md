# Docker blue-green

A reusable, framework-independent foundation for Blue-Green deployments using Docker Compose and Caddy.

## Features

- Initialize an existing Docker Compose project without rewriting its source files.
- Separate application services from long-lived infrastructure.
- Prepare isolated Blue/Green application project names and a shared Docker network.
- Preserve service configuration, named volumes and relative paths where safe.
- Generate `.env.example` with empty values, and avoid overwriting customized deployment files.
- Install a release workflow that builds and publishes versioned OCI images through a reusable, pinned workflow.

Automatic traffic switching, deployment and rollback are not yet implemented.

## Requirements

- Go 1.23 or later (to build the CLI).
- Docker Engine with Docker Compose v2 (to import an existing Compose project).

## Installation

From this repository:

```bash
go build -o bluegreen ./cmd/bluegreen
```

## Usage

Run inside an existing project:

```bash
bluegreen init
```

The CLI discovers `compose.yaml`, `compose.yml`, `docker-compose.yaml` or `docker-compose.yml` and asks whether each service is part of the application or shared infrastructure. For unattended setup, specify the classification explicitly:

```bash
bluegreen init --dir /path/to/project --app api,frontend --infrastructure postgres,redis
```

Select another input with `--compose path/to/file.yml`. If no Compose file exists, `init` creates a minimal application and Caddy configuration that can be customized.

The generated files are:

```text
deploy/
├── compose.yml
└── infrastructure/
    ├── compose.yml
    └── caddy/
        ├── Caddyfile
        └── routes/
.github/workflows/release.yml
.env.example
```

Set the environment variables required by the generated Compose files. Application images use per-service variables such as `API_IMAGE` so that releases can provide immutable image references. Host-published application ports are converted into container-only exposed ports; shared infrastructure remains outside the Blue/Green slots.

The CLI does not start containers or deploy releases. It rejects configurations that cannot be split safely, and does not replace existing deployment files with different contents.

## Publishing images

A published GitHub Release builds every application service with a `build` definition in `deploy/compose.yml`. The images are pushed to the configured OCI registry with the release tag. Each resulting image digest is uploaded as a workflow artifact for later deployment.

Set these repository or environment variables in GitHub Actions: `REGISTRY_URL` (registry host), `REGISTRY_REPOSITORY` (repository/image prefix), and `REGISTRY_USERNAME`. Add the secret `GIT_REGISTRY_TOKEN` with permission to push to that registry. The registry can be GHCR or any compatible OCI registry.

The generated workflow calls the shared publisher at a fixed commit for reproducibility. Publishing does not deploy or restart services.
